But like any good restoration project, the plan is to build it up over time, one piece at a time, with care and the occasional moment of colourful language when something doesn't fit.\n\nPull up a chair, have a browse, and welcome aboard. The road is open, the sun is out (for now), and the side curtains are stowed behind the seat... somewhere.`,\n    category: \"News\",\n    featured: true,\n  },\n  {\n    slug: \"five-excuses-for-another-parts-car\",\n    title: \"Top 5 Excuses for Buying Another Parts Car\",\n    date: \"2025-01-28\",\n    excerpt:\n      \"We've all been there. Here are the finest justifications known to humankind.\",\n    content: `Every British roadster enthusiast has uttered at least one of these phrases. Most of us have used all five. No judgement here.\n\n**5. \"It was too cheap to pass up.\"**\nThe classic opener. It doesn't matter that you have nowhere to put it. At that price, you'd be losing money by NOT buying it. That's just basic economics.\n\n**4. \"I only need the gearbox.\"**\nAnd the doors. And the boot lid. And maybe the wiring loom. And actually, that engine sounds alright...\n\n**3. \"It'll be a quick project for the winter.\"**\nSaid in October. Still saying it the following October. And the one after that.\n\n**2. \"They're not making any more of them.\"**\nTechnically true. Emotionally devastating when deployed against a spouse who's just noticed the trailer in the driveway.\n\n**1. \"It's an investment.\"**\nThe nuclear option. Bold, audacious, and surprisingly effective if delivered with enough conviction and a chart you found on the internet showing appreciating values.\n\nIf you've got a better excuse, we'd love to hear it in the forum. Bonus points if it actually worked.`,\n    category: \"Fun\",\n  },\n  {\n    slug: \"lucas-electrics-survival-guide\",\n    title: \"A Beginner's Guide to Lucas Electrics (and Prayer)\",\n    date: \"2025-01-20\",\n    excerpt:\n      \"Joseph Lucas, Prince of Darkness. Here's how to keep the lights on... sometimes.\",\n    content: `There's an old joke: Why do the British drink warm beer? Because Lucas makes their refrigerators.\n\nLove them or loathe them, Lucas electrical systems are part of the post-war British car experience. They're also the source of more roadside conversations with strangers than any other component.\n\n**The Basics**\n\nMost post-war British roadsters use positive earth (positive ground) systems — at least until the late 1960s when manufacturers began switching to negative earth. Knowing which you have is step one. Getting it wrong is step one of an expensive afternoon.\n\n**The Golden Rules**\n\n1. **Clean your earth points.** Ninety percent of Lucas \"failures\" are actually bad grounds. A wire brush and five minutes can save you hours of head-scratching.\n\n2. **Carry spare fuses.** And a spare flasher unit. And a spare ignition condenser. Actually, just carry a spare of everything.\n\n3. **Check your bullet connectors.** Those lovely little brass connectors corrode beautifully over the decades. Pull them apart, clean them up, and put them back. Your lights will thank you.\n\n4. **The wiring diagram is your friend.** It looks terrifying at first, but British car wiring is actually quite logical once you learn the colour code system. Brown is always live, green is ignition-switched, and white is... well, it depends.\n\n5. **When in doubt, check the voltage.** A simple multimeter will tell you more than an hour of guessing.\n\nRemember: Lucas systems aren't actually unreliable. They're just... characterful. Like everything else on these cars, they reward attention and patience.\n\nAnd if all else fails, there's always a torch and a long walk home. It's part of the adventure.`,\n    category: \"Technical\",\n  },\n  {\n    slug: \"the-mg-t-series-love-letter\",\n    title: \"A Love Letter to the MG T-Series\",\n    date: \"2025-01-15\",\n    excerpt:\n      \"The TC, TD, and TF — the cars that started the sports car revolution.\",\n    content: `When American GIs returned home after the war, many brought something unexpected with them: a taste for small, nimble British sports cars. And more often than not, the car that had caught their eye was an MG.\n\nThe T-Series — TC, TD, and TF — didn't have the most power, the best handling, or the most advanced engineering. What they had was something harder to quantify: character, charm, and the pure joy of open-air motoring on a sunny afternoon.\n\n**The TC (1945-1949)**\n\nThe car that started it all for so many enthusiasts. Essentially a pre-war design with a few updates, the TC was charmingly old-fashioned even when it was new. Fold-flat windscreen, cut-away doors, a slab fuel tank on the back, and that glorious octagonal badge on the grille.\n\n**The TD (1950-1953)**\n\nThe modern one. Independent front suspension! Rack and pinion steering! Bumpers! The purists weren't happy, but the TD was easier to drive, more comfortable, and sold in huge numbers — especially in America.\n\n**The TF (1953-1955)**\n\nThe swan song. A facelifted TD with a sloped grille, individual fenders blended into the body, and a more refined look. It was criticised at launch for not being modern enough, but time has been very kind to the TF. Many consider it the prettiest of the three.\n\nTogether, these three cars lit the spark that became the entire post-war sports car movement. Every Miata, every Boxster, every modern roadster owes something to the little MG that could.\n\nNot bad for a car with 54 horsepower.`,\n    category: \"History\",\n  },\n];\n","import Link from \"next/link\";\nimport { blogPosts } from \"@/data/blogPosts\";\n\nexport default function BlogPage() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4 py-12\">\n      {/* Header */}\n      <div className=\"text-center mb-12\">\n        <h1 className=\"text-4xl font-bold text-brg mb-3\">The Blog</h1>\n        <p className=\"text-leather italic text-lg\">\n          Stories, history, tips, and the occasional excuse for buying another parts car\n        </p>\n        <div className=\"w-16 h-1 bg-leather mx-auto mt-4 rounded\" />\n      </div>\n\n      {/* Category Filter (static for now) */}\n      <div className=\"flex flex-wrap justify-center gap-2 mb-10\">\n        {[\"All\", \"News\", \"History\", \"Technical\", \"Fun\"].map((cat) => (\n          <span\n            key={cat}\n            className={`px-4 py-2 rounded-full text-sm font-medium cursor-default transition-colors ${\n              cat === \"All\"\n                ? \"bg-brg text-cream\"\n                : \"bg-cream-dark text-brg hover:bg-brg hover:text-cream\"\n            }`}\n          >\n            {cat}\n          </span>\n        ))}\n      </div>\n\n      {/* Posts List */}\n      <div className=\"space-y-8\">\n        {blogPosts.map((post) => (\n          <article\n            key={post.slug}\n            className=\"bg-white rounded-xl shadow-md p-6 md:p-8 hover:shadow-lg transition-shadow border-l-4 border-brg\"\n          >\n            <div className=\"flex flex-wrap items-center gap-3 mb-3\">\n              <span className=\"bg-cream-dark text-leather text-xs px-3 py-1 rounded-full font-medium\">\n                {post.category}\n              </span>\n              <span className=\"text-sm text-leather\">{post.date}</span>\n              {post.featured && (\n                <span className=\"bg-brg text-cream text-xs px-3 py-1 rounded-full font-semibold\">\n                  FEATURED\n                </span>\n              )}\n            </div>\n            <h2 className=\"text-2xl font-bold text-brg mb-3\">\n              <Link href={`/blog/${post.slug}`} className=\"hover:text-brg-light transition-colors\">\n                {post.title}\n              </Link>\n            </h2>\n            <p className=\"text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4\">{post.excerpt}</p>\n            <Link\n              href={`/blog/${post.slug}`}\n              className=\"text-brg font-semibold hover:text-brg-light transition-colors\"\n            >\n              Read the full article →\n            </Link>\n          </article>\n        ))}\n      </div>\n\n      {/* Coming Soon Note */}\n      <div className=\"text-center mt-12 p-8 bg-cream-dark rounded-xl\">\n        <p className=\"text-leather italic\">\n          More stories coming soon.
